# AgriScan: Smart Leaf Disease Detection System

**AgriScan: Smart Leaf Disease Detection System** is a project created for farmer welfare. Designed to resolve the issue of plant diseases, it uses leaf-based disease detection.

The proposed mobile application will be a tool featuring an intuitive UI with features dedicated towards:
* Educating farmers about how to prevent crop wastage.
* Ensuring a healthier and more bountiful yield.
